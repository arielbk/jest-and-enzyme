[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/arielbk/jest-and-enzyme.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/arielbk/jest-and-enzyme) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/arielbk/jest-and-enzyme/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/arielbk/jest-and-enzyme?branch=master)

Currently following along with Bonnie Schulkin's [React Testing with Jest and Enzyme](https://www.udemy.com/react-testing-with-jest-and-enzyme/) course on Udemy.

Boilerplate React code is from Jedai Saboteur's article [Creating a React App... From Scratch.](https://blog.usejournal.com/creating-a-react-app-from-scratch-f3c693b84658)

Testing Redux with React can be tricky. Redux' [official docs](https://redux.js.org/recipes/writing-tests) has some helpful ideas about this. From the course, writing a store creator test utility helps to be able to test the state of it, and [Moxios](https://github.com/axios/moxios) is useful to mock a Redux store and test whch Redux actions have been called on it.
